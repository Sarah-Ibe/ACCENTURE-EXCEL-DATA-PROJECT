# ACCENTURE-EXCEL-DATA-PROJECT


## üìä Project Overview: Content Popularity Analysis for Accenture

### üß≠ Objective
As part of a business task from Accenture following my completion of an Introduction to Excel course, I was asked to analyze client content data to determine the **top 5 content categories with the largest popularity**. The goal was to provide actionable insights into which types of content resonate most with users based on reaction scores.

---

### üìÅ Data Source & Structure
The analysis was based on three interconnected datasets:
- **Content**: Contains content ID, category, and content type.
- **Reaction**: Includes user reactions tied to content ID.
- **Reaction Type**: Maps each reaction type to a sentiment and a numeric score.

Popularity was defined by the **aggregate reaction score** per content category. To calculate this, I needed to merge the datasets and sum scores by category.

### üßπ Data Cleaning
Using Excel, I performed the following cleaning steps:
- **Removed duplicates** using Excel‚Äôs ‚ÄúRemove Duplicates‚Äù tool.
- **Filtered and deleted blank rows** from key columns using the filter function.
- **Eliminated irrelevant columns** such as User ID and URL to streamline the dataset.
- Ensured the final cleaned dataset contained **24,574 rows** of valid data.

### üîó Data Modeling
To prepare the data for analysis:
- I **converted the cleaned data into structured tables**.
- Using **VLOOKUP**, I merged:
  - The **Reaction** table with the **Content** table via `Content ID` to retrieve category and content type.

  - The **Reaction** table with the **Reaction Type** table via `Reaction Type` to retrieve sentiment and score.

This created a unified dataset where each reaction was linked to its content category and associated score.

### üìà Analysis & Insights
To identify the most popular categories:
- I extracted a list of **unique content categories**.
- Using **SUMIF**, I calculated the **total reaction score** for each category:
  ```excel
  =SUMIF('Cleaned data modelled table'!F:F, 'Popular Categories'!A2, 'Cleaned data modelled table'!H:H)
  ```

- I then **sorted the categories by total score in descending order** to identify the top 5.

---

### üß† Outcome
The final result was a ranked list of the **top 5 content categories** based on user engagement and sentiment scores. This analysis provides the client with a clear view of which content types are driving the most positive reactions, helping guide future content strategy.
